COMPal is a Command Line Interface calendar application that targets students who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their busy student life. COMPal captures your timetable in a user-friendly layout, giving you an informative overview of your schedule in a brief glance. 

Additionally, you can include non-academic activities along with your academic timetable, unlike other widely-used timetable tools. You also have the freedom to prioritise certain tasks over less important ones, and make use of timely reminders on pending tasks.
